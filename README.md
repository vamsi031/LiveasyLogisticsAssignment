In this assignment, I've implemented the following APIs and made some additions to support the given functionality:

"Add Load" API: This API allows the addition of load details along with the shipper ID. To facilitate this,
I've created the "Shipper" entity and included APIs to "Add" and "Delete" shippers. These APIs help in obtaining 
the shipper ID, which is essential for adding loads to the database.

"Get Loads by Shipper ID" API: This API retrieves a list of all the loads associated with a specific shipper ID.

"Get Load by Load ID" API: This API retrieves the load entity based on a given load ID.

"Update Load by Load ID" API: This API enables the update of the date within an existing load entity.

"Delete Load by Load ID" API: This API is used to delete the corresponding load entity using its load ID.

These APIs collectively provide a comprehensive solution for managing loads and associated data.
